# Images are inline elements

This means that they only take up as much horizontal space as their width and it can effect how the content following it behaves. Here are three examples of an images positioned before, at the beginning and in the middle of a paragraph element. We'll learn more about inline vs block elements, but for now it's just important to be aware that a block element, such as a paragraph, always starts on a new line, whereas text following an image will flow immediately to the right on the same line.
